## About Me
I am a senior software engineer currently building out web and mobile applications with React and React Native. 
In addition to those technologies, I also enjoy working with Node and Python to bring data and useful APIs into my applications.

### Outside of work I can be found
- relaxing with video games
- traveling to and exploring new places
- walking around the park enjoying some sunshine
- exploring how to improve ergonomics in my setup

### Tools I use every day
#### Keyboard:
KBDFans D65 - NK Milkshakes - GMK Redacted <br>
(Soon to be Dygma Defy!)
