## About Me
I am a full time software engineer currently building web and mobile apps and leading a team of 7 at Valcom, Inc. I am currently working heavily in React and Node, and starting also to get into Python regularly. When I am not working, I am most likely spending my time playing video games, hanging out with family, and working on building out a couple of personal projects.
