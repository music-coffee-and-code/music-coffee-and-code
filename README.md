## About Me
I am a full time software engineer currently building web and mobile apps and leading a development team of 7. I work heavily in React, React Native, and Node.

### Outside of work I can be found
- traveling to and exploring new places
- playing video games with friends
- planning my next trips
- learning about theology
- dreaming of being an astronaut while contemplating if I could build a self landing model rocket

Currently: Cartagena, Colombia
